# LyA-InvertPhase

A project with Andrew Pontzen, Andreu Font and Keir Rogers to test if leveraging a pair of simulations with inverted phases in their ICs can more efficiently constrain cosmological parameters from observations. We are testing if the average of these paired simulations containing baryon physics can decrease the variance in the average power spectrum for extracting cosmology from lyalpha forest power spectra observations.
